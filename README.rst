Llat: The Last Layer Algorithm Trainer
======================================

A python tool for learning speedcubing algorithms with voice commands.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A interactive terminal based app for a flashcard style system to help you learn last layer
algorithms.

The algorithms are from `ALGDB.net <http://algdb.net/>`__.

Currently very Alpha, most work going on in the ``experimental/`` subdirectory, figuring out how to
get the components to work.
